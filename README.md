# Sir.glala
My Discord bot :3 \
nothing special but I am still working on my bot :>

pip requirements:
    py-cord
    python-dotenv

For personal use just create a file called .env and add the lines:
    DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_OWN_TOKEN

If u want to use docker there is already a pre made Dockerfile and a .dockerignore
to built the docker file:
    docker build -t YOURIMAGETAG .
